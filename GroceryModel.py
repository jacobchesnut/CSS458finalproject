def MoveCustomer(customerToMove, storeShelves, allCustomers):
    """
    MoveCustomer
    attempts to move a customer towards their next primary item
    the way customer movement works is as follows:
    the first action is to compare the customer position against all other
    customer positions, shelf positions, and shop boundaries to figure out
    which directions are available to move in.
    
    The next action is to find the coordinates of the closest primary item
    
    after these coordinates are found, the Y-axis position of the item and
    customer are compared. if the difference between positions is 1, then
    moving in the Y-direction will be ignored. otherwise the customer will
    attempt to move in the Y-direction if possible.
    
    if the customer does not move in the Y-axis, they will instead to move
    in the X direction. If Y-axis movement was ignored before this, that is
    to say, that the customer is aligned in the Y-axis to purchase the item,
    then the customer will attempt to move in the direction of the item.
    If the customer is not Y-axis aligned, it will instead choose to move in
    the direction of the closest shop boundary, if possible.
    
    if all attempted movement options have been prevented by this point,
    then the customer will attempt to move in any direction, chosen at random
    
    If the customer is blocked in all directions, it will stay still
    
    
    this movement pattern assumes that the shop is created with horizontal
    (parallel to X-axis) shelves, and that none of the shelves create corners
    with each other.
